# DESIGN-PRINCIPLES 
SOLID principles are foundational to writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

ðŸ’¡ What is SOLID?
 SOLID is an acronym for five key object-oriented design principles that help developers build robust and scalable software:

âœ… S - Single Responsibility Principle
 A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

âœ… O - Open/Closed Principle
 Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new behavior without changing existing, tested code.

âœ… L - Liskov Substitution Principle
 Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. Inheritance should preserve behavior.

âœ… I - Interface Segregation Principle
 Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they donâ€™t use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

âœ… D - Dependency Inversion Principle
 High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. This promotes loose coupling and easier testing.
